## Code Style Guidelines

### JavaScript/React
- Use ES6+ syntax
- Prefer `const` over `let`, avoid `var`
- Use arrow functions for callbacks
- Use destructuring where appropriate
- Use template literals for string interpolation
- Keep functions small and focused
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

### React Components
- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components focused on single responsibility
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use descriptive prop names
- Validate props when necessary

### File Naming
- Components: PascalCase (e.g., `StreamControls.jsx`)
- Services: camelCase (e.g., `streamService.js`)
- CSS: Match component name (e.g., `StreamControls.css`)
