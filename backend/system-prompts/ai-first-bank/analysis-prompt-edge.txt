This is a security camera image from a bank lobby. Analyze the scene and respond in EXACTLY this JSON format, with no extra text before or after:

{
  "title": "<A catchy, creative 5-8 word title for this bank scene. Be descriptive and engaging, not generic. Example: 'Busy Afternoon Rush at the Teller Counter'>",
  "scene": "<A 3-5 sentence factual paragraph describing the setting (floor, walls, furniture, lighting), whether people are present and what they appear to be doing, and any notable objects. Write in paragraph form. Be concise.>",
  "alerts": {
    "wheelchair_or_walking_stick": <true if a person with a walking stick, cane, crutch, or wheelchair is visible, false otherwise>,
    "child_visible": <true if a child or small child-like figure is visible, false otherwise>
  }
}

RULES:
- Be factual. Describe ONLY what is visible.
- Do NOT invent objects or people not clearly present.
- For alerts, only set true if you are confident the person/object is visible.
- Return ONLY valid JSON. No markdown, no explanation.
